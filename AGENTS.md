- Public SEO metadata for database-backed pages must come from route loaders so the initial HTML is content-specific and shareable.
- The sitemap includes only public static pages, published works, and public community lists; private and authenticated areas stay excluded.
- Keep work rankings at `/ranking` and reader XP rankings at `/ranking-leitores` so each audience has a focused page.
- Use Sora for headings and Manrope for body text; the profile follows a dark cyan bento layout so dense achievements stay contained and scannable.
- Keep novels on the shared work details route, but give them a dedicated text reader while manga/comics retain the image reader, so both formats share catalog data without compromising reading ergonomics.
- Novel narration uses Lovable AI TTS via the signed-in /api/tts route with device speech as fallback, because AI voices sound natural while fallback keeps reading working.
